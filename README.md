## Acknowledgments

I took this challenge whilst i was in the middle of my Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele, to try to practice what i have learned. During the challenge, i had to refer back to some of his subjects, which made things more clear. Thanks Colt.

And thank you Wilfred, for mentoring me on some sections and giving great advice.
